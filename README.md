## Project Intent

Drink With Me was originally a sample project built from concept to presentation in a 2-week sprint with a team of 4 developers.  The project concept was to create a social review and rating application to find where the best mixed drinks are made.

This fork will serve as a launching point for addressing the issue in the original sprint, and bring the project to completion as I originally envisioned it.
